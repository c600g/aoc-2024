# Advent of Code 2024

I've never participated in this, and as I've been meaning to learn the rust programming language,
I figured this was a good exercize.

Note that I started a day or two late, and managed to catch up around day 10 or so. I'm not doing
this competetively, as I would need to jump on the nexy day's problem at 9:00 pm. So, I'm trying
to attack it this first thing in the morning when possible.
